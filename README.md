## Hi there! 👋

**About Me**

I am a Computer Engineering student at [TMU](https://www.torontomu.ca/) with a deep passion for building cool stuff and a drive to push the boundaries of innovation. My current focus is on building projects with React, and I look forward to showcasing my work soon. ✨

I am always eager to learn new technologies and challenge myself to grow as a developer. Beyond coding, I enjoy socializing and building meaningful connections with others. 🤍
